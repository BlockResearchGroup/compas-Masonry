Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) is an extension to 3D of the well-known graphic statics thrust line method. In TNA, the internal compressive forces in the structure are modelled as a discrete network. Unlike previous methods, TNA is not based on a specific discretisation and can be applied even if no block discretisation is known. If a compressive network is found within the structure's geometry, then the masonry structure is considered safe.&#x20;
