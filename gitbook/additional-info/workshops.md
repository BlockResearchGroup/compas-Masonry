# Workshops

A few selected workshops executed during the development of COMPAS Masonry are listed here.

## International Summer School: Historic Masonry Structures (2019-2022)

COMPAS Masonry has been used as a tool by the students of the Masonry Summer School since 2019 to perform structural calculations of historic masonry structure. In this immersive 2-weeks summer school international students visit a city in Europe and inspect a few selected monuments from the comunity such as churches, monasteries, etc. Students are divided in groups and at the end of the course each group must submit a document compiling geometric, architectural and structural features of the monument and, if necessary, suggest interventions.&#x20;

## Discrete computational mechanics of Masonry Strutures 2021 (CISM course)

COMPAS Masonry has been used as a tool studied in the Discrete computational mechanics of Masonry Strutures international APT course. This course was organised by the International Centre for Mechanical Sciences (CISM) that took place in 26-30 July 2021 in Udine, Italy.
